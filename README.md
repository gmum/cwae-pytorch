# Repository info

This repository contains an implementation of Cramer-Wold AutoEncoder(CWAE) in PyTorch, proposed by [Szymon Knop, Przemysław Spurek, Jacek Tabor, Igor Podolak, Marcin Mazur, Stanisław Jastrzębski (2018)](https://jmlr.org/papers/v21/19-560.html). TensorFlow version is available [here](https://github.com/gmum/cwae).

```

Experiments are written in `pytorch-lightning` to decouple the science code from the engineering. The `LightningModule` implementation is in `train_autoencoder.py` file. For more details refer to [PyTorch-Lightning documentation](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning)

# Conducting the experiments

To execute experiments described in Table 1 in the paper run scripts located in `src/reproduce_table1.sh`

Apart from CWAE model, the repository supports running WAE, SWAE, and vanilla AE models. All of the implementations are based on the respective papers and repositories.

## Browsing the results

Results are stored in tensorboard format. To browse them run the following command:
`tensorboard --logdir results`

## Reproducing the results

Below are the obtained FID scores for experiments conducted with this repository's code:
|              	|  SWAE 	| WAE-MMD 	|  CWAE 	|
|--------------	|------:	|--------:	|------:	|
| MNIST        	| 30.94 	|  28.71  	| 24.22 	|
| FashionMNIST 	| 55.99 	|  51.74  	| 50.35 	|
| CIFAR-10     	| 131.6 	|  136.6  	| 118.1 	|
| CELEBA       	| 62.42 	|  51.29  	| 48.02 	|

Reported results may vary a little from the ones reported in the paper because implemented architectures in PyTorch slightly differ from the original ones. Relations between FID Scores obtained by different models are the same as the ones reported in the paper.

## Other options

The code allows manipulating some of the parameters(for example using other versions of the model, changing learning rate values) for more info see the list of available arguments in `src/args_parser.py` file

To run the unit tests execute the following command:
`python -m unittest`

# Datasets

The repository uses default datasets provided by PyTorch for MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CELEBA. To convert CELEB-A to 64x64 images we first center crop images to 140x140 and then resize them to 64x64.
